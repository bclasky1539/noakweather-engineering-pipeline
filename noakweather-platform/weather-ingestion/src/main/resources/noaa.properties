# NOAA Aviation Weather API Configuration
# Adapted from legacy configuration

# NOAA Aviation Weather Configuration
# Updated to use correct TG FTP service endpoints

# ============================================================================
# NOAA TG FTP Service URLs (CORRECT)
# ============================================================================
# These are the official NOAA text data service endpoints
# METAR: Current weather observations
# TAF: Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (6-30 hour forecasts)

noaa.metar.base.url=https://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/observations/metar/stations
noaa.taf.base.url=https://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/forecasts/taf/stations

# ============================================================================
# Connection Settings
# ============================================================================
# Timeout for HTTP requests in seconds
noaa.timeout.seconds=30

# Number of retry attempts if request fails
noaa.retry.attempts=3

# Delay between retry attempts in milliseconds
noaa.retry.delay.ms=1000

# ============================================================================
# NOTES
# ============================================================================
# Individual station URLs are constructed as:
# METAR: {noaa.metar.base.url}/{STATION_ID}.TXT
# TAF: {noaa.taf.base.url}/{STATION_ID}.TXT
#
# Examples:
# https://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/observations/metar/stations/KCLT.TXT
# https://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/forecasts/taf/stations/KBUF.TXT
