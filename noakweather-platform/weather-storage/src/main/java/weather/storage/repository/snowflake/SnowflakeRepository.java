/**
 * Snowflake implementation of the UniversalWeatherRepository.
 * 
 * STUB IMPLEMENTATION
 * This is a placeholder for future Snowflake integration in the batch layer.
 * 
 * Snowflake serves as the immutable master data store in Lambda Architecture:
 * - Batch Layer: Stores complete historical weather data
 * - Optimized for: Large-scale analytics, time-series queries, data warehousing
 * - Use case: Historical analysis, trend detection, ML training data
 * 
 * - Implement Snowflake JDBC connection pooling
 * - Create efficient batch insert procedures
 * - Implement partition strategy (by date/station)
 * - Add connection health checks
 * - Implement proper error handling and retry logic
