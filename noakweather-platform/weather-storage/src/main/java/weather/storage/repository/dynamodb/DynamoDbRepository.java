/**
 * DynamoDB implementation of the UniversalWeatherRepository.
 * 
 * STUB IMPLEMENTATION
 * This is a placeholder for future DynamoDB integration in the speed/serving layer.
 * 
 * DynamoDB serves as the real-time data store in Lambda Architecture:
 * - Speed Layer: Stores recent weather data for fast access
 * - Serving Layer: Provides low-latency queries for APIs
 * - Optimized for: Sub-millisecond reads, high throughput, scalability
 * - Use case: Current weather lookups, recent history (last 7-30 days)
 * 
 * Design considerations:
 * - Partition Key: station_id (for even distribution and fast lookups)
 * - Sort Key: observation_time (for time-range queries)
 * - TTL: Auto-expire records after 30 days (batch layer has full history)
 * 
 * - Implement AWS SDK DynamoDB client setup
 * - Create table schema with GSI for source queries
 * - Implement efficient batch writes (25 items max per batch)
 * - Add conditional writes for idempotency
 * - Implement exponential backoff retry logic
 * - Set up TTL for automatic data expiration
 * - Add CloudWatch metrics integration
